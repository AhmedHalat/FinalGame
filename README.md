          **FinalGame**
#By Mohamed and Ahmed

  -Some of our sprites have pink particles around them. That isn't a bug in the code. When they were exported from photoshop the files were compressed and some of the colors were slightly changed and is now handled differently.
  -Mobs sometimes spawn outside of the map. I used the randomizer equations we use in class and am unsure why this happens
      *Never Mind I think I fixed the spawning issue*
  -To get a weapon at the start of the game left click on the chest or in the bottom right corner of the screen when in the main room
